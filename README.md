# INDicator

This tool modifies a Music 2000 / MTV Music Generator executable to load any WAD/IND combination of your choice.

Supports both PC and PlayStation versions.

Should work on Windows, macOS and any flavour of Linux. It has, however, only been tested on Windows so YMMV.

## Usage

`INDicator.exe <executable-file> <wad-filename> <pc | psx> <m2k | mtvmg>`

## Build Instructions

`g++ indicator.cpp -o INDicator`
